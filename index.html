          I enjoy building spatial solutions for the web using the most popular web mapping APIs in modern frameworks and libraries. For more sophisticated solutions, check them out on <a href='https://github.com/erikbrawner' _blank='target' rel='noopener noreferrer' title='Link to GitHub'>GitHub</a>

          <!--Hey there! As a geospatial developer, I've had the privilege of working with some amazing technologies that help me bring maps and spatial data to life. Here's a rundown of my expertise:

JavaScript and TypeScript: I'm proficient in both JavaScript and TypeScript, which are the bread and butter of web development. I've used them to build interactive web applications, leverage APIs, and create custom mapping solutions.

React: I love working with React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It's perfect for creating scalable and maintainable applications, and I've used it to build some amazing mapping apps.

Python: Python is another favorite of mine, and I've used it for a wide range of geospatial tasks, from data analysis to scripting. I'm proficient in the ArcGIS Python API, which allows me to automate tasks, build custom tools, and integrate with other systems.

ArcGIS JavaScript API: This API is a powerhouse for building web-based mapping applications. I've used it to create custom maps, integrate with other systems, and build interactive mapping experiences.

ArcGIS Python API: As I mentioned earlier, I'm proficient in the ArcGIS Python API, which allows me to automate tasks, build custom tools, and integrate with other systems.

Cesium: Cesium is an amazing JavaScript library for building 3D globes and maps. I've used it to create stunning visualizations and interactive mapping experiences.

What does this mean for you?

As a geospatial developer with expertise in these technologies, I can help you build custom mapping solutions, integrate spatial data into your applications, and create interactive mapping experiences. Whether you're looking to build a web-based mapping application, automate geospatial tasks, or integrate spatial data into your existing systems, I'm here to help.
